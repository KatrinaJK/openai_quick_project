Abstract Coffea arabica L. is a famous specie in genus caffee for medicinal treatment and diet with wide
distribution and rich resources. It contains rich alkaloids, flavonoids and terpenes, which exhibited antioxidation,
anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antidiabetic, live protection, and neuroprotective activities. Herein, we summarized
the progress in the chemical constituents and bioactivities of C. arabica L. to provide ideas for medicinal
development prospects of C. arabica L.

Introduction
Flavonoids
Coffee is one of the most important agricultural products in Flavonoids and their glycosides are widely present in the
the world and is mainly distributed in Central and South leaves of C. arabica L. They are classified into different groups
